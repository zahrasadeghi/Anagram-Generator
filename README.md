# NLP Project: Anagram Generator 

This program will help you to find all anagrams of a Persian word.<br />
An anagram, as you know, is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.<br />
There are similar projects which find English anagrams, but this project is designed especially for Persian words.<br />
The main challenge was to handle "half-space" problem which is a writing rule in the Persian language. We resolved this problem by replacing all "half-spaces" in words with space.<br />
This will not cause any problems because "half-spaces" are not changing the meaning of Persian words.
